read -r -d '' MESSAGE << EOM
If you use apache and want to enable the adminer interface just run the
following command as root:

echo "Include conf/extra/httpd-adminer.conf" >> /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Restart apache (systemctl restart httpd) and then you can access adminer on
http://localhost/adminer.
