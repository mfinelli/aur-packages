n installs node versions to subdirectory n/versions of the directory
specified in environment variable N_PREFIX, which defaults to
/usr/local; the active node/iojs version is installed directly in
N_PREFIX. To change the default to, say, $HOME, prefix later calls to
n with N_PREFIX=$HOME or add export N_PREFIX=$HOME to your shell
initialization file.

See the n README for more information: https://github.com/tj/n
